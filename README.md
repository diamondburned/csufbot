# csufbot

An unofficial Discord bot for students from CSU Fullerton to use for their own
Discord servers.

## Contributing Guidelines

- Code must use `goimports`. Commits made by GoLand must use `goimports` as
	well.
- All lines of code must be at maximum 100 columns long. Comments must be at
	maximum 80 columns long. Tab size must be 4 columns.
- Prioritize readability and correctness over performance.
- Editor-specific files such as `.vscode` must not be added to the project or
	its `.gitignore` file.

## Using for other Universities

This bot can be used for other universities with fairly trivial tweaks. However,
**all modifications to the source code must abide by the GNU Affero General
Public License**, that is, they must be open source and available for everyone
to download.
